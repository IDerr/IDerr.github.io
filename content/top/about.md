I am **IDerr**, a Freelance DevOps engineer based in Paris.

Throughout my career, I have built a number of large-scale systems and operation tools, most of them are still running in production.

I have strong interests in various tech stuff such as Artificial Intelligence, Cryptocurrencies and Smart Home.

I hold a Master degree in Computer Science and Technology from ENSIIE Engineer school in France.

I am working at Exaion, a new EDF Group subsidiary specialized in Blockchain, Cloud computing and HPC, and at the same time, I try to create my own products.

I am happy with my current job, but also willing to take new extra challenges on the side if the opportunity matches my career path and my vision.

During my free time, I enjoy watching TV, hacking my own car, traveling, writing blogs and learning languages.
