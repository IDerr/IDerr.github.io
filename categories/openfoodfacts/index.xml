I wanted to work on OpenFoodFacts data, but never found MongoDB really great to work with, so I decided to migrate the CSV Data to Postgres, and clean the database (and give back a bit to this awesome community ! )
You can find all my work on my Github : https://github.com/IDerr/Openfoodfacts
How to download OpenFoodFacts data OpenFoodFacts provides all their data for free on their website, with three different formats: Json (based on their mongodb database), CSV and RDF You can download al the data on their website: https://openfoodfacts.</description></item></channel></rss>
